    <h2 class="head-font">Wild life</h2>
    <p>
      Despite its small size, Sri Lanka possesses a high level of biodiversity
      and wildlife resources and is rated among the 34 biodiversity hotspots in
      the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many species of flora and fauna are indigenous to Sri Lanka. This has made
      the island a country with the highest rates of biological endemism in the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forbes ranked Sri Lanka as one of top wildlife safaris outside of
      Africa,[28] due to the actual presence of five charismatic megafauna (The
      Big Five) and the relative ease of seeing them during a single tour
      itinerary.[29] The Leopard, the Asian elephant and Sloth Bear are found in
      several national parks. The Yala National Park has one of the highest
      concentrations of leopards in the world.

    <h2 class="head-font">Tasting street food</h2>
    <p>
      Sri Lankan cuisine is known for its particular combinations of herbs,
      spices, fish, vegetables, rices, and fruits. The cuisine is highly
      centered around many varieties of rice, as well as coconut which is a
      ubiquitous plant throughout the country. Seafood also plays a significant
      role in the cuisine, be it fresh fish or preserved fish
    </p>
    <p>
      As a country that was a hub in the historic oceanic silk road, contact
      with foreign traders brought new food items and cultural influences in
      addition to the local traditions of the country's ethnic groups, all of
      which have helped shape Sri Lankan cuisine. Influences from Indian
      (particularly South Indian), Indonesian and Dutch cuisines are most
      evident with Sri Lankan cuisine sharing close ties to other neighbouring
      South and Southeast Asian cuisines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sri Lanka is historically famous for its cinnamon. The 'true cinnamon'
      tree, or Cinnamomum verum, used to be botanically named Cinnamomum
      zeylanicum to reflect its Sri Lankan origins

      snorkelling, deep-sea fishing, underwater photography, and scuba diving,
