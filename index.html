        Sri Lanka is a popular tourist destination. Tourism is a key industry
        that attracts international tourists yearly. Foreigners visit Sri Lanka
        to see nature, wildlife, historical monuments, and indigenous culture.
        In 2018, tourist arrivals peaked at 2.5 million, who spent a total of
        US$5.6 billion in the country. However, the COVID-19 pandemic caused
        tourist numbers to decrease by 92% in 2020. As of 2022, tourist numbers
        have not rebounded from the pre-crisis high. The government is
        attempting to attract foreign investment in the country's tourism
        industry, which began in earnest after the end of the Sri Lankan Civil
        War in 2009.

      <h2>Take these few steps</h2>
      <p>
        If you are planning to visit Sri Lanka for more than a week (which I
        would totally recommend), bear in mind that the perfect amount of days
        to explore the Island, would be between 13 and 15 days,also,depending on
        your vacation duration and budget, it is very common to combine this
        trip with an extension
      </p>
      <p>
        Domestic flights in Sri Lanka are quite limited. So for public
        transportation, you can choose between train and bus, which are cheap
        but slow and uncomfortable. The most efficient and convenient way to get
        around Sri Lanka is by hiring a private car and driver or for shorter
        distances to take a taxi or tuk-tuk.

        <li>
          Determine Your Travel Style and Interests:
          <p>Adventure Seeker: Consider trekking in the Knuckles Mountain Range, surfing in Weligama, or white-water rafting in Kitulgala.

        </li>
        
        <li> 
          Choose Your Travel Dates and Budget:

          <p>
            Peak Season (December to April): Offers pleasant weather but higher prices.
            Shoulder Season (May to June and September to October): Comfortable temperatures and fewer crowds.
